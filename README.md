# Bandcamp Downloader GUI

A Python-based GUI application for downloading Bandcamp albums with full metadata and cover art support.

## Why This Exists

This was created as an interim solution for users experiencing issues with [Otiel's BandcampDownloader](https://github.com/Otiel/BandcampDownloader). While we wait for official updates and fixes to that excellent C# application, this Python-based alternative provides a working solution.

## What It Does

Bandcamp Downloader GUI provides a simple way to download the freely available 128 kbps MP3 streams from Bandcamp albums, tracks, and artist pages. It automatically organizes files, embeds metadata, and handles cover art.

## Key Features

* **Simple GUI** - No command-line knowledge required
* **Smart Organization** - Choose from 5 folder structures (Artist/Album is default)
* **Complete Metadata** - Automatically tags files with artist, album, track number, and date
* **Cover Art Handling** - Embeds artwork into files and optionally saves separate copies
* **Format Flexibility** - Output as MP3, FLAC, OGG, or WAV (note: all converted from 128 kbps source)
* **Track Numbering** - Optional automatic track number prefixes
* **Playlist Generation** - Create .m3u playlists automatically
* **Auto-Setup** - Checks dependencies and guides you through installation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11 or higher**
   * Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   * ⚠️ **Must check "Add Python to PATH" during installation**

2. **ffmpeg.exe**
   * Download: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
   * Get `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip`
   * Extract `ffmpeg.exe` from the `bin` folder
   * Place it in the same folder as `bandcamp_dl_gui.py`

### Installation

1. Download the repository files and place in a folder
2. Place `ffmpeg.exe` in the folder
3. Double-click `Bandcamp Downloader GUI.bat` (optionally create a shortcut to this file and pin it to your startmenu, taskbar, desktop, etc)
4. The app will check for and help install any missing dependencies

That's it! No manual package installation needed - the script handles it.

### Supported URLs

* Album pages: `https://[artist].bandcamp.com/album/[album]`
* Track pages: `https://[artist].bandcamp.com/track/[track]`
* Artist pages: `https://[artist].bandcamp.com` (downloads all available albums)

## Troubleshooting

**"Python not found"**
- Reinstall Python and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
- Or manually add Python to your system PATH

**"ffmpeg.exe not found"**
- Download from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
- Place `ffmpeg.exe` in the same folder as the script

**"No files downloaded"**
- Album may require purchase
- Some content is only available after buying
- Verify the album streams for free on Bandcamp

**Album art not displaying in Interface**
- Install Pillow: `python -m pip install Pillow`
- The app will prompt to install it automatically

### ⚠️ Important Quality Notice

This tool downloads the **128 kbps MP3 streams** that Bandcamp makes available for free listening. These are the same quality files you hear when streaming on the website.

**Converting to FLAC, OGG, or WAV does NOT improve quality** - it only changes the file format. The source remains 128 kbps.

### 🎵 Support Artists

For high-quality audio (FLAC, 320 kbps MP3, etc.), **please purchase albums directly from Bandcamp**. 

Bandcamp is one of the best platforms for independent artists:
* Artists receive a larger share of revenue than other platforms
* You get high-quality downloads with your purchase
* You're directly supporting the musicians you love

**If you enjoy the music, please support the artists by purchasing their work!**

## Credits & Inspiration

This project exists thanks to [Otiel's BandcampDownloader](https://github.com/Otiel/BandcampDownloader). This Python version was created to provide a working alternative while we await updates to the original project.

**Thank you, Otiel, for the inspiration and for building such a useful tool!**

## Legal & Ethical Use

This tool is designed for:
* Personal use of music you own or have permission to download
* Accessing freely available stream files
* Building a local library of music you've purchased

Please respect copyright laws and Bandcamp's terms of service. Support artists by purchasing music when possible.
